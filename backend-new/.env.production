# For Vercel deployment, set these as environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
# SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY should be set in Vercel, not here

# For local development, uncomment and replace with your actual Supabase credentials:
# SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
# SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here

# Server port (Vercel will override this)
